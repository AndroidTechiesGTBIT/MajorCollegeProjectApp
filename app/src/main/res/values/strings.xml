    <string name="intro_one">Hinton is a fake news generator (video) platform that aims to create
awareness among the society about how fake new generation is
possible and it aims to make people believe not to blindly follow
what is seen on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.
The main working of the project comes in form that we can alter
facial expressions in a video live upto an extent that it is very
difficult to distinguish between original and generated video.
We use ResNet34 model trained to detect 68 points facial
landmarks on the target video, pix2pix research paper for creating a
GAN that has 2 neural networks I.e a discriminator and a generator
both trained on Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras separately for
comparisons and then combined to make the final architecture of
the pix2pix model</string>
